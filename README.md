# Assignment 3 part 2 - Create your own chatbot

In assignment 3 you created a chatbot from a movie database. In this group project (no more than 4 people in a group, or you can work individually) you are tasked to create your own chatbot for something that is more relavant to you. You can use our solution as a starting point for your own chatbot, or you could do something completely different.

## Where to start

In your group, come up with an idea of what you want to make. Once you do that, research what data is out there and if you need to make a database or if you just want to use a database that exists already. You are also welcomed to see if there are any python modules that you could use to help you along the way.

If you want the simplest solution to this project, then you can simply expand on the solution that we did in class. Add at least 20 movies to the database in varying years, add at least one more action function, and add at least five more searchest to the pa_list.

You are receiving a blank slate here. You will need to create the entire structure for this project. Feel free to adapt in any way you would like to. I will be asking what you will be working on at the start of the next class period so that you have time to decide. HAVE FUN with this!!

## How you will be graded

We will be presenting what we do to the class. This presentation can be you and your group with the program and presenting what you created, or it can be a slides presentation. I want to see the program during the presentation, but it is okay if the final result doesn't work. I care more about what you wanted to accomplish and what you did along the way. You can be ambitious with this and if it doesn't work out, your grade will not be reduced.

## github

One member of your group will clone this repository. It is a public repository, so the rest of your group can clone that persons repository. Once you have done that, maybe you want to research how to create branches and work on the same repository on separate branches and then slowly merge them together. This is not required, but I would like you to try to have multiple people working on the same repository. Do some research and be willing to make mistakes, you'll learn from them...I will too.

## Timeframe

We will work on this for at least a week, maybe more. That really isn't that much time (5 total hours), so I don't expect you to create a ton of new things. More importantly I want you to try some new things and see where it takes you. No due date right now, but I am envisioning finishing any coding for the assignment by next Friday and then presentations on Tuesday of the following week.
